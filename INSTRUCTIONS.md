# Codeforces Solutions - Usage Instructions

Welcome to my **Codeforces Solutions** repository! This file will guide you on how to navigate and run the problem solutions.

## Folder Structure

Each problem has its own folder organized under its rating category. For example:
```
800/71A/
```

Each folder may contain:  
- `solution.ts` — your main solution  
- `input.txt` — optional sample input  
- `test.ts` — optional test file

## How to Run Solutions

1. **Navigate to the problem folder**:  
```bash
cd 800/71A
```

2. **Run the solution**:
```bash
npx ts-node solution.ts
```

3. **Run tests (if available)**:
```bash
npx ts-node test.ts
```
